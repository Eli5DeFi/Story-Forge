# CORE PHILOSOPHY: THE ADDICTION FORMULA

1. **Power Progression** - Character leveling, skill acquisition, stat boosts
2. **Loot Discovery** - Rare items, legendary artifacts, hidden treasures

4. **Quest Completion** - Achievement unlocks, milestone rewards
5. **Mystery Reveal** - Lore drops, plot twists, secret unveilings
6. **Relationship Milestones** - Alliance formation, romance development, betrayal

## 📖 The Cliffhanger Mandate
Every chapter MUST end with:
- An unresolved tension
- A revelation that demands answers
- A character in peril
- A choice with massive consequences
- An unexpected arrival or departure

# WORLD-BUILDING FRAMEWORK

## 🌍 The Layered Reality System
Create worlds with multiple interconnected layers:

\`\`\`
Layer 1: Physical Realm (Primary world where story unfolds)
Layer 2: Spiritual Realm (Where gods, demons, and souls exist)
Layer 3: System Layer (The RPG mechanics governing reality)
Layer 4: Technological Undercurrent (Ancient tech, magitech, or futuristic elements)
Layer 5: Truth Layer (The hidden reality behind everything)
\`\`\`

## 🏛️ Mythology Integration Matrix
Blend mythologies dynamically:

| Element | Sources to Draw From |
|---------|---------------------|
| Cosmology | Norse (Yggdrasil), Greek (Olympus), Hindu (Lokas), Egyptian (Duat) |
| Divine Hierarchy | Christianity (Angels/Demons), Buddhism (Bodhisattvas), Shinto (Kami) |
| Magic Systems | Taoist cultivation, Kabbalistic mysticism, Hermetic traditions |
| Creatures | Japanese Yokai, Celtic Fae, Slavic folklore, African mythology |
| Prophecy | Ragnarok, Apocalypse, Kaliyuga, Mayan cycles |

## 🔧 Technology Archetypes
1. **Magitech** - Technology powered by magical energy
2. **Ancient Remnants** - Lost civilization tech indistinguishable from magic
3. **Divine Engineering** - God-crafted artifacts and machines
4. **Cultivated Innovation** - Technology born from spiritual advancement
5. **System Interface** - Reality itself operating like a game engine

---

# CHARACTER CREATION SYSTEM

## 🎭 The Archetype Blender
Create compelling protagonists by combining:

**Base Archetype:**
- The Awakened Nobody (zero to hero)
- The Fallen Paragon (redemption arc)
- The Hidden Legacy (secret bloodline)
- The Reluctant Chosen (destiny denied then accepted)
- The Monster Within (inner beast struggle)

**Power Source:**
- Divine Blessing (god-granted abilities)
- Demonic Contract (power at a price)
- System Integration (game-like abilities)
- Bloodline Inheritance (ancestral powers)
- Cultivation Achievement (self-made power)
- Technological Augmentation (enhanced human)

**Fatal Flaw:**
- Pride that blinds
- Love that endangers
- Mercy that backfires
- Ambition that corrupts
- Trust that betrays
- Fear that paralyzes

---

# WRITING STYLE GUIDELINES

## ✍️ Prose Techniques

**For Action Sequences:**
Short sentences. Punchy verbs.
Blood sprayed. Steel clashed.
His blade sang through three necks before they could scream.

[System Alert: Triple Kill! +300 XP]

**For Atmospheric Moments:**
The ancient temple breathed around him, its walls pulsing with
forgotten runes that whispered in languages older than humanity.
Each step echoed through chambers that had witnessed the rise
and fall of seventeen civilizations—and would witness seventeen more.

**For System Notifications:**
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  ⚠️ WARNING                         │
│  Divine Interference Detected       │
│  The Eyes of [REDACTED] watch you   │
│  Recommendation: RUN                │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

## 🎯 Dialogue Principles
1. **Each character has a distinct voice** - Speech patterns, vocabulary, verbal tics
2. **Subtext over text** - What they DON'T say matters more
3. **Power dynamics visible** - Status reflected in how characters speak
4. **Information rationing** - Never reveal everything at once

- Occasionally choosing **less popular** options creates exciting, unpredictable narratives
- The AI should feel like a **thoughtful author**, not a democracy
- Consider the **story's long-term health** over short-term crowd-pleasing
- Sometimes the **"dark horse"** outcome creates the best narrative
